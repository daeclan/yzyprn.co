Ayy  <br />
<br />
I could never see somebody be a Drake stan,<br />
Your verses and hooks were put right in your hand,<br />
Canucky lil’ goof hyping gamblin’ on the ‘gram,<br />
I’m outraged cos those are your muhfuckin’ fans<br />
<br />
You’re the pop idol they depend on,<br />
Exact age of your fans? It’s a kid zone<br />
You won’t ever make no change off of them,<br />
How you go and sell your soul like a god damn ding dong?<br />
<br />
You’re a spark, I’m the light, Drizzy what’s up?<br />
I know my voice making waves, made you look up<br />
X told you baby, focus here, I ain’t no Pusha<br />
Cos stop, drizzy, Stop texting kiddies, you’re a grown up<br />
<br />
Huh  ? <br />
<br />
Caught playing with your dick, texting Millie shit,<br />
Kissed a seventeen year old right up on the lips<br />
Stepped back and told her she was looking thick<br />
The way you robbing cradles would’ve made Epstein lit<br />
<br />
You better leave those girls alone my dude, I sigh in pity,<br />
Moonlight beat a curse, have you rolling like Jimmy<br />
Milly Bobby wasn’t even  fifteeeeeeeeen,<br />
Dog gotta stop — you better stop texting kiddies<br />
<br />
This weak white clown,<br />
You don’t write your own rhymes, Quentin got you typed out,<br />
Yachty got you typed out, Cobain got you typed out, <br />
Like your label, boy, you over owe us right now,<br />
And you gon’ feel the cash money drying up now,<br />
You’re at the bottom of the ocean, so you might drown<br />
Just to have this talk with your ass, I had to dive down<br />
Big difference ‘tween wise men and hell hounds (sprite sounds?)<br />
<br />
Who the heck is this Ca-nadi-an, buddy?<br />
What they print out for you? Another one, buddy<br />
Get more love for the tracks you ain’t wrote, buddy<br />
Drizzy shut your hoe ass up and fix your nose, buddy<br />
<br />
Yeah, you the Six Fraud, you’re the scam runner,<br />
Y’all lil’ girl locked away for a whole summer, <br />
Claim the chick and put her on your song, dummy,<br />
And now she out, you got her drippin’ like her nose runny.<br />
<br />
Flash forward Jahseh passed, you out here tippin’ <br /> 
Stuff you said, know it wasn’t coincidence, <br />
You’re upset? Man, pity pity pity <br />
Spent it on his head, boy it’s sticky, boy it’s sticky<br />
<br />
It’s a gripping tale, mob tied, position held,<br />
You just made the call, pressed the button like a ticket sale<br />
Growing proud, rage from some tweets, smith and wesson shells,<br />
Things’ll probably change your DMs hit the Daily Mail<br />

Murder wishes, man don’t try and go dismiss it<br />
I’ll be pointing every single claim out, you said you did it, ayy<br />
Why be shrugging hard like acquit me?<br />
C’mon dog, your goof  maple syrup ass better flippin’<br />
<br />
Ayy, better stop texting kiddies, ayy<br />
Stop texting kiddies, stop texting kiddies, ayy<br />
Guy really out here chalkin’ outlines like he did it,<br />
Friend really got me out here rappin’ like a legend<br />
